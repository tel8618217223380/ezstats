I would be very happy if you want to translate ezStats into your language. This is very simple:

  1. Please create a new issue, or send me a eMail, with the language you want to translate to
  1. I will send you then a link to a online tool I programmed
  1. I this tool you've just to enter the translated texts in the belonged input fields. Everytime you leave a input field with the cursor, the text is saved automatically
  1. You can enter the fields blank if you want to use the english text
  1. If you have the text translated, I publish the language files with the next update

In the texts there are some control characters that should not be changed:

  * `$name` and `$name->value` stands for a variable. ezStats filles text in there. Please don't translate the name of the variable.
  * `[br]` stands for a line break
  * `[b]` and `[/b]` stands for bold start/end
  * `[]` stands for a whitespace
