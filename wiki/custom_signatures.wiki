#summary How to create custom signatures in ezStats

== Introduction ==

ezStats offers three different signatures for each player, which yo can adjust slightly. But perhaps you like only "med"-signature, but want two or more of them with different background images. This article explains, how you can realize this by some modifications of ezStats.

The program I use for editing of the source code is [http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ Notepad++]

== Details ==

Download the file `tmp/defaults.js` and open it in Notepad++. Scroll down to the end of the file, and copy the entries of the signature you want to duplicate. In this case `med`.

Now paste the code after `"min_background_offset": "0"`. Change the prefix of the duplicated lines into "custom1" for example. Please be sure that all lines end with a comma, exept the last one.

Now save the file and upload it. Then download the file `classes/signatures.php` and open it in Notepad++. In line 9, append the prefix "custom1" to the array.

Search now for the string `function create_rankicon`. The search function opens with "CTRL+F". Copy and paste the If-loop you want to use as pattern and, in this example, rename "med" with "custom1".
