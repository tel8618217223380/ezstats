#summary How to translate ezStats into another language

I would be very happy if you want to translate ezStats into your language. This is very simple:

  # Please create a new issue, or send me a eMail, with the language you want to translate to
  # I will send you then a link to a online tool I programmed
  # I this tool you've just to enter the translated texts in the belonged input fields. Everytime you leave a input field with the cursor, the text is saved automatically
  # You can enter the fields blank if you want to use the english text
  # If you have the text translated, I publish the language files with the next update

In the texts there are some control characters that should not be changed:

  * `$name` and `$name->value` stands for a variable. ezStats filles text in there. Please don't translate the name of the variable.
  * `[br]` stands for a line break
  * `[b]` and `[/b]` stands for bold start/end
  *  `[]` stands for a whitespace
