#summary Socket error message 110 in ezStats Serverviewer:

_*Warning:* socket_connect() [function.socket-connect]: unable to connect [110]: Connection timed out_


=== Introduction === 

Apparently, your server does not support sockets, or any server setting is blocking it. But those sockets are neccessary for ezStats to contact your gameserver.


===  Whats next? === 

Please contact the support of your webserver. Please write them the message below, and hopefully they change the settings of your server then.

=== Message ===

I have executed the following PHP-Code on my server, and on a server of another provider:
{{{
    socket_connect(
        socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, SOL_TCP),
        "91.198.152.176",
        25506
    );
}}}

While on the foreign server, the connection is established, on my server, this error appears:
{{{
    Warning: socket_connect() [function.socket-connect]: unable to connect [110]: Connection timed out in ...
}}}

Please change the settings of my server, so I can use sockets.
