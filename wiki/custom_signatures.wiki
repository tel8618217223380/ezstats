#summary How to create custom signatures in ezStats

== Introduction ==

ezStats offers three different signatures for each player, which yo can adjust slightly. But perhaps you like only "med"-signature, but want five of them with different background images. This article explains, how you can realize this by some modifications of ezStats.

The program I use for editing of the source code is [http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ Notepad++]

== Details ==

Download the file `tmp/defaults.js` and open it in Notepad++. Scroll down to the end of the file, and copy the entries of the signature you want to duplicate. In this case `med`.

Now paste the code after `"min_background_offset": "0"`. Change the prefix of the duplicated lines into "custom1_" for example. Please be sure that all lines end with a comma, exept the last one.
